Mechanical Keyboard & Keypad Designs & My process Iterating them

## Overview

Since June 2024, I have been designing and prototyping mechanical keypads in order to learn more about PCB Design, electronics, firmware, 3D Modeling, and design for manufacturing. Since then, I have gone through 5 iterations, improving on price, footprint/profile, and usability. I hope to end up with a fully polished design that passes as an actual product available from a manufacturer.
